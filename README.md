APM-Parameter-Files
===================

Finding an APM parameter file for your specific aircraft can be a pain in the ass.

I've tried to assemble here a set of files that various people have tried out and recommended. 
I have not tried all of these parameters personally and cannot personally rate their efficacy. 
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

In most cases, having these as a starting point for your own exploration is better than having no
parameter file at all. However, there are many variations in build quality, takeoff weight and so forth
that will cause your maiden flight to be different than the param file author's nth flight.
